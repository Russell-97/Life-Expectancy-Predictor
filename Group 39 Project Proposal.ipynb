    "In this exploratory data analysis, we aim to explore the relationship between life expectancy and social services across various countries. Life expectancy is a critical metric reflecting the overall health and well-being of a population, while social services encompass a wide range of factors such as healthcare access, education, economic stability, and social support systems.\r\n",

    "Understanding how these social services impact life expectancy can provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations striving to improve public health outcomes. Through data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, we will investigate patterns, correlations, and predictive capabilities to gain deeper insights into this important relationship.\r\n",
